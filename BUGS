This file contains both cl-ana bugs as well as issues caused by Lisp
and other libraries that cl-ana uses.  For upstream bugs, work-arounds
and supported versions are documented here.

cl-ana:

* HDF5 1.10 does not seem to work on my system, but HDF5
  1.8.15-patch1_2 (ARCH Linux version) and below works fine.  Not sure
  what the source of the problem is.

UPSTREAM:

GSLL:

* GSLL from quicklisp (gsll-master-80875db6-git) fails to process GSL
  2.1-2 source code with grovel.  It turns out that other libraries
  are failing to build against GSL as well due to an API change.  GSL
  1.16 seems to work fine with this GSLL however.

  UPDATE: This might be fixed in the new GSLL now, needs more
  stringent testing.

* There is a bug in this file in gsll:

  solve-minimize-fit/nonlinear-least-squares.lisp

  The function ls-covariance is not supplying the jacobian function
  with a result matrix.  I've modified this file and will try to
  contact upstream about the solution.  My modification is found under

  upstream/gsll/solve-minimize-fit/nonlinear-least-squares.lisp

  If all else fails, you can copy this file directly into your
  quicklisp version of GSLL in the mean time.

flexi-streams:

* flexi-streams needs to have trivial-gray-streams loaded
  independently from quicklisp on the initial load.  I don't have any
  idea when this is loaded, but I did run into an error loading
  flexi-streams while trying to load cl-ana after a system update so
  I'm putting this note here for future reference.
