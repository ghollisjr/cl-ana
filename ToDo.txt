* Allow users to specify an update strategy for re-specifying targets
  (i.e. executing defres).  For now I've set the default to keeping
  the old value in place but setting the status to nil ("needs to be
  computed")

* Test various graph transformations

  Of special interest is the collapsing of table passes.  Approach:
  Use new form (tabred table bindings &body body) which will be
  interpreted as executing body inside a loop over table with bindings
  declared outside the loop.  These bindings can be collapsed into a
  single let/let*, and the bodies can be executed in parallel as long
  as there are no interdependencies.  If there are interdependencies,
  then more than one pass will be required, but this same strategy can
  be applied to all the results which depend on first pass values, so
  that second pass values happen in a single second pass, and so on.
