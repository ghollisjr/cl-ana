logres:

- Each target and logged file should come with a timestamp so that
  versions of targets and files can be compared.  This would be useful
  for e.g. sending files to another computer and only updating the
  files which have differing timestamps as well as only saving targets
  which have changed when saving a project.

+ Use SHA1 sums for checking work files

  This is partially completed, but I need to find a way to easily
  track sha1 sums for files.  At the moment, it's turning into a
  monolithic monster whereas I would rather have operators provided
  which automate the management of the sha1 sums.

+ Logging functionality may need to be partially supported by graph
  transformations so that targets can be saved to disk and cleared
  from memory to avoid memory bottlenecks on low-memory systems.  It's
  already taking ~ 1.5 GB for my PhD analysis just to store all the
  histograms etc. in memory.

+ Single function/macro for defining a makeres+logres project along
  with common settings.

makeres:

+ Add tabletrans operator which allows multiple targets to be defined
  and computed as a block.  Would greatly assist in allowing
  e.g. multiple maps over the same computed list, fitting data (since
  functions themselves cannot be logged but the parameters can,
  requiring multiple targets per fit).

  Could have a macro defresblock defining a result block.  Would take
  the ids of the computed results as arguments and would define
  temporary versions of the targets.  The tabletrans transformations
  would take care of providing e.g. the ability to refer specifically
  to which target you want to incrementally compute throughout the
  block.

  This could actually provide a better platform for implementing the
  table transformations as well, as the merging of table passes
  ultimately computes multiple targets at once, meaning that at least
  some of the work currently done by makeres-table could be moved to
  this new tabletrans library.

+ Logging functionality may best be provided in the compiled function
  of compres.  Each target would have as its path its res id.  Each
  target would get its own directory, and inside a target's directory
  would be a timestamp file as well as the saved information from the
  target.  Each kind of target could have its own methods for storage,
  be it a single binary file or multiple files along with an index
  file.  Deleting a result could then automatically delete the stored
  result as well if desired.

* Some way to control when and how transformations are loaded into the
  pipeline that doesn't require the user to know the exact ordering
  required.  As it stands, you have to know that e.g. macro
  transformations are required for table transformations, and that the
  transformed macros should be expanded prior to table
  transformations.

makeres-macro:

+ Add ability to define functions and still have dependencies tracked.
  This should be done simply by defining a new function definition
  operator, define-res-function, which will store its dependencies in
  a table.  Then, the makeres-macro tabletrans function will use this
  information as it code walks, looking for any calls to a
  res-function in a body and adding dependencies to the affected
  targets accordingly.

makeres-table:

+ Source table definition with bootstrapping.  At the moment, the user
  is tasked with opening source tables and handling the situation when
  the source material for a table is not present.  There should be an
  operator, perhaps stab, which allows the definition of a source
  table.

+ Perhaps renaming the operator tab to ptab.  If the above stab
  operator is implemented, then having stab, ptab, and ltab is more
  symmetrical and potentially easier to remember than having stab,
  tab, and ltab, since physical tables won't be as special once a
  separate operator is made for source tables.
